# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is currently focused on providing a stable API interface for AI services with the following key areas:

1. **Core API Functionality**

   - Text chat endpoints
   - Vision/image analysis capabilities
   - Image generation features
   - Provider-agnostic interfaces

2. **Database Management**

   - User data persistence
   - Conversation history
   - Model configurations
   - System settings

3. **Provider Integration**
   - OpenAI implementation
   - Anthropic implementation
   - Standardized response handling
   - Error management

## Recent Changes

Based on migration history and codebase:

1. **Database Schema Updates**

   - Added email and admin user fields
   - Created personas relationship
